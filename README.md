Ebay-Scapper
============

Just a casual side project for my friend and dad.

The URL for search results on Ebay should end with "sop=10" to sort entries into "newly listed items"

Website listing eBay URL syntax: http://www.helios825.org/url-parameters.php

May want to look into jsoup.org. Looks like a good java library for easily parsing HTML.
www.jsoup.org

Took the liberty to add JSoup as explained. For your IDE you must add the newly included JAR file by going to Project>Properties>Java Build Path>Libraries and then adding the included jar file which lives at the top level directory of the project folder.
